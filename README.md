## Algorithm 1
This is the assignment in coursera lecture [Algorithm1 courses](https://class.coursera.org/algs4partI-010) by by Kevin Wayne, Robert Sedgewick(Prof. in Princeton). I strongly recommend do not read this code before you write your own code. This code can be helpful to break through when you have some trouble. There is no perfect code in my opinion, and I think you can write the code much better than mine. I hope you just referenced this and make improvement on your own code. Discussion is very welcome.
